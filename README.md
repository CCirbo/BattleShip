# Written reflection:
1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
- without an interaction pattern we had to visualize how playing the game would occur, we looked at the methods and classes made in interactions 1 and 2 as a base for how we developed the game play pattern.
- wanted to provide a fun experience for user (personalized text && ASCII art).
- without an interaction pattern we were able to explore how WE wanted to develop the gameplay.
- active user testing as we wrote code (ping-ponging), we wrote code, we played the game, we saw the results and we adjusted accordingly.
2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
- Decouple the `game.rb` so that we could test the isolated methods more effectively. We could also work on implementing the deliverables for iteration 4.
3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
- We did a lot of tandem solo work, because this could lead to miscommunications we made an active effort to communicate al ot. We ping ponged the code base back and forth too where one of us developed a section of code and the other would code around the other's idea.
- we also did driver navigator where once the code was written, we would debug/refactor with each other live, this allowed us to more effectively fix bugs. We took an active role in refactoring each other's code, again this could've led to mixed results if we hadn't communicated so proactively.
4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
- Mostly verbal, we did share feedback in slack. we communicated minimally over github, because the other avenues of communication worked more effectively. There was a lot of positive feedback, we had very few disagreements because we defined the relationship so thoroughly. We both did a good job defining our work styles in DTR which led to appropriate expectations and for our workflow, and communication.
